# Tasks

## What are tasks

Every time you run `npx Redspot xxx`, you are running tasks. For example, `npx redspot compile` runs the compilation task. 

To view the tasks currently available by redspot
```bash
npx redspot
```

Run the `npx redspot --help` command to view the help information.

```bash
Redspot version 0.11.4
Usage: redspot [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <TASK> [TASK OPTIONS]
GLOBAL OPTIONS:
  --config                   A Redspot config file.
  --help                     Shows this message, or a task's help if its name is provided
  --log-level                Set log levels 1-5 (default: "2")
  --max-memory               The maximum amount of memory that Redspot can use.
  --network                  The network to connect to.
  --show-stack-traces        Show stack traces.
  --tsconfig                 Reserved redspot argument -- Has no effect.
  --verbose                  Enables Redspot verbose logging
  --version                  Shows redspot's version.

AVAILABLE TASKS:
  clean           Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  compile         Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
  console         Opens a redspot console
  explorer        Start redspot explorer
  help            Prints this message
  run             Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project
  test            Runs mocha tests
  testnet         Running the test network
To get help for a specific task run: npx redspot help [task]
```

## Global OPTIONS

*** Defines the global configuration of Redspot runtime. It can be attached to any task. *** 

To specify the connection to the Substrate network (substrate network needs to be configured in config).

```
npx redspot test --network substrate
``` 
To specify the level of the log to be printed, and the log level is 2 by default
```
npx redspot test --log-level 3
```

You can also set GLOBAL OPTIONS through environment variables.

Set the log level: 
```
REDSPOT_LOG_LEVEL=5 npx redspot test
```
Set up the network: 
```
REDSPOT_NETWORK=substrate npx redspot test.
```

## Task OPTIONS
Usually each task will provide its own parameter configuration.
For example
```bash
$ npx redspot compile --help
Redspot version 0.11.4

Usage: redspot [GLOBAL OPTIONS] compile --docker <BOOLEAN> --quiet <BOOLEAN> [...sourcePattern]

OPTIONS:

  --docker	Compiling with docker 
  --quiet 	Check for document changes 

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS:

  sourcePattern	A glob string that is matched against (default: [])

compile: Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts

For global options help run: redspot help

```

For compiling commands, you can pass in the path of the contract to specify the contract that needs to be compiled, for example,`npx redspot compile examples/erc20`.

## `clean`
Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts generated by Redspot

## `compile`

To compile your contracts in your Redspot project, use the built-in compile task:
```bash
redspot [GLOBAL OPTIONS] compile --docker <BOOLEAN> --quiet <BOOLEAN> [...sourcePattern]
```
Currently supports the compilation of [ink](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) contracts and [Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-labs/solang) contracts. When compiling the ink contract, please make sure you have installed [cargo-contract](https://github.com/paritytech/cargo-contract). When compiling the Solang contract, please make sure you have installed [Solang](https://solang.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html#building-solang-from-crates-io). In redspot.config.ts, you can configure compilation options.

```typescript
{
        ...
        contract: {
    ink: {
      toolchain: 'nightly', // set the cargo-contract compile-time toolchain
      sources: ['contracts/**/*'] // Configure the directory to find the contract files
    },
    solang: {
      sources: ['contracts/**/*.sol'] // Configure the directory to find contract files
    }
  },
  paths: {
          ...
    artifacts: 'artifacts' // specify the directory where the contract compilation products are stored
    ...
  }
  ...
}
```
The compile command receives the sourcePattern parameter, which can override the sources in the configuration file, for example:

`npx redspot compile examples/erc20`:It will only find contracts in the examples/erc20 directory.

Once the compilation is complete, the files generated after compilation can be found in the `artifacts` directory. There are usually two kinds of format,`[ContractName].contract`and`[ContractName].json`. The only difference between them is that Wasm is not included in `.json`, and the size is smaller. You can also use your own tools to compile, and then copy the `[ContractName].contract` file to the artifacts directory. This will not affect the use of other functions.
### compile task options
`--docker <BOOLEAN>`: boolean to indicate compiling with docker. For details, please refer [Docker](./docker)
`--quiet <BOOLEAN>`: if there is no change to contract code or redspot config, the compilation will be skipped
`sourcePattern`: A glob string that is matched against, so you can specify which contract to compile. For example, 
```
npx redspot compile erc20
```
will only compile the contract code under `erc20` directory.
With no `sourcePattern` sepecified, it will compile the code under `contracts` directory  

## `console` 	
Opens a redspot console. For details, please refer [Redspot Console](./console)
```bash
$ npx redspot console
```

## `explorer`	
Start redspot explorer. For details, please refer [Redspot Explorer](./explorer)
```bash
npx redspot explorer
```


## `help`  	
```bash
npx redspot --help
Redspot version 0.11.4

Usage: redspot [GLOBAL OPTIONS] <TASK> [TASK OPTIONS]

GLOBAL OPTIONS:

  --config           	A Redspot config file. 
  --help             	Shows this message, or a task's help if its name is provided 
  --log-level        	Set log levels 1-5 (default: "2")
  --max-memory       	The maximum amount of memory that Redspot can use. 
  --network          	The network to connect to. 
  --show-stack-traces	Show stack traces.

  --version          	Shows redspot's version. 


AVAILABLE TASKS:

  check   	Check whatever you need
  clean   	Clears the cache and deletes all artifacts
  compile 	Compiles the entire project, building all artifacts
  console 	Opens a redspot console
  explorer	Start redspot explorer
  help    	Prints this message
  run     	Runs a user-defined script after compiling the project

To get help for a specific task run: npx redspot help [task]
```

## `testnet`
`Testnet` task will execute command in docker env. Please refer [Docker](./docker) for details.

## `test`
Automated testing helps developers avoid repeating tasks. Test requires the blockchain node to be setup properly. Please refer to [Installation](../intro/installation) to learn how to setup the blockchain test node.
The test can be configured through `redspot.config.ts`
```bash
{
        defaultNetwork: "development", // the default network to connect to
        ...
        networks: {
                        development: {
          endpoint: "ws://127.0.0.1:9944", // url of the network to connect to (websocket)
          types: {}, // Type definitions to be passed to polkadotjs for use
          accounts: ["//Alice", "tomato mad peasant blush poem obtain inspire distance attitude mercy return marriage"] // The account to use for the signature, default is ['// Alice', '//Bob', '//Charlie', '//Dave', '//Eve', '//Ferdie']
          gasLimit: "400000000000", // default gaslimit
      },
        }
        path: {
                tests: 'tests', // directory to find test files
        },
        mocha: {
                timeout: 60000, // timeout for mocha tests
                ...
        }
        ...
}
```

You can also configure the test blockchain network through Environmental variable in command, for example:

`REDSPOT_NETWORK=development npx redpost test`

### test task options
`--no-compile`: indicate running `compile` task before running this task.For example 
```bash
npx redspot test --no-compile
```

`--source-pattern`:	You can also specify which test file to be executed, For example,
```bash
npx redspot test ./tests/[filename].ts
```

### writing your test file
Test uses mocha as the test framework by default. You can configure mocha options in the redspot.config.ts file. For all supported options, see [mocha](https://mochajs.org/api/mocha).

Here is sample test file

```typescript
import BN from 'bn.js';
import { expect } from 'chai';
import { patract, network, artifacts } from 'redspot';
const { getContractFactory, getRandomSigner } = patract;
const { api, getSigners } = network;
describe('ERC20', () => {
  after(() => {
    return api.disconnect();
  });
  async function setup() {
    const one = new BN(10).pow(new BN(api.registry.chainDecimals[0]));
    const signers = await getSigners();
    const Alice = signers[0];
    const sender = Alice;
    const contractFactory = await getContractFactory('erc20', sender);
    const contract = await contractFactory.deploy('new', '1000');
    const abi = artifacts.readArtifact('erc20');
    const receiver = await getRandomSigner();
    return { sender, contractFactory, contract, abi, receiver, Alice, one };
  }
  it('Assigns initial balance', async () => {
    const { contract, sender } = await setup();
    const result = await contract.query.balanceOf(sender.address);
    expect(result.output).to.equal(1000);
  });
  it('Transfer emits event', async () => {
    const { contract, sender, receiver } = await setup();
    await expect(contract.tx.transfer(receiver.address, 7))
      .to.emit(contract, 'Transfer')
      .withArgs(sender.address, receiver.address, 7);
  });
  it('Can not transfer above the amount', async () => {
    const { contract, receiver } = await setup();
    await expect(contract.tx.transfer(receiver.address, 1007)).to.not.emit(
      contract,
      'Transfer'
    );
  });
  it('Can not transfer from empty account', async () => {
    const { contract, Alice, one, sender } = await setup();
    const emptyAccount = await getRandomSigner(Alice, one.muln(10000));
    await expect(
      contract.tx.transfer(sender.address, 7, {
        signer: emptyAccount
      })
    ).to.not.emit(contract, 'Transfer');
  });
});
```
```typescript
  async function setup() {
  }
```
* The `setup` function creates random account called `Alice` and assigned fixed balance to this account. This account will then be used to perform various tests to ensure that the test results are the same every time.
* In this test file, two Redspot plugins are used，`@redspot/patract` and `@redspot/chai`. For details, please refer [Plugins](../plugin/plugin.md)
* `npx redspot test` wraps to `mocha` to perform the test. You can directly `mocha` command to run. For example, you can run test:
```bash
TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=true mocha -r ts-node/register tests/erc20.test.ts --timeout 60000
```
** TO Use ts-node to compile and run typescript code, you need to add `-r ts-node/register`.`TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=true`Sets ts-node to ignore typescript type errors when running.


## `run`
The Run command can be used to run any typescript file. Setting `--no-compile` can avoid automatically running the compilation command `npx redspot run --no-compile`.

Like Test, it is just a command wrap around `TS_NODE_TRANSPILE_ONLY=true node -r ts-node/register [filepath]`.

We used `npx redspot run` for deployment in [Quick Start](../intro/Quick Start)
You can use Run to run the deployment script, for example:

```typescript
import { network, patract } from 'redspot';
const { getContractFactory } = patract;
const { getSigners, api } = network;
async function run() {
  console.log('deploy erc20');
  await api.isReady;
  console.log('deploy erc201');
  const signers = await getSigners();
  const signer = signers[0];
  const contractFactory = await getContractFactory('erc20', signer);
  const contract = await contractFactory.deploy('new', '1000000', {
    gasLimit: '200000000000',
    value: '10000000000000000'
  });
  console.log(
    'Deploy successfully. The contract address: ',
    contract.address.toString()
  );
  api.disconnect();
}
run().catch(err => {
  console.log(err);
});
```
This deployment script deploys the contract to targetted network and returns the contract address that holds the `erc20` contract.

The [@redspot/patract](../plugin/redspot-patract.md) plug-in is used here as `getContractFactory`.

## `console`

You can start a Node [REPL](https://nodejs.dev/learn/how-to-use-the-nodejs-repl) console by running the `npx redspot console` command. It has a built-in Redspot Runtime Environment, where you can access plug-ins, configurations, and tasks provided by Redspot. For details, please refer `Console`(./console)
