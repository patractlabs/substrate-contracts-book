## Overview

The communication between PatraStore and Dapp uses PostMessage to communicate. For the convenience of developers, we provide a set of SDK. This set of SDK implements the protocol in [polkadot-js/extension](https://github.com/polkadot-js/extension), so our SDK can be fully compatible with [@polkadot/extension-dapp](https ://www.npmjs.com/package/@polkadot/extension-dapp).

Developers can easily import PatraStore's SDK. We provide CDN service to host the SDK. You only need to include `<script type="text/javascript" src="https://static.patrastore.io/sdk in the code. /store-sdk.min.js"></script>`.
