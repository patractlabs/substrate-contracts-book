# What is Redspotï¼Ÿ

Redspot is a contract integration construction tool that makes ink!, Ask! and other contract development projects, and simplifies contract testing and interaction.

## Background Information

* Redspot's functions run through the entire contract development process. You can build rich plug-ins to extend Redspot's functions, automate the process of repeating steps, and minimize your burden.
* Redspot's design goal is similar to Truffle in the Ethereum ecosystem, but has a wider range of extended functions than Truffle.
* Redspot is a flexible system. The pallet-contracts contract module can be integrated into the Substrate chain directly or after a certain degree of modification. [Hardhat ](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat) has an excellent design architecture that allows plug-ins to add new features, so Redspot uses hardhat as its core architecture.
## More information

Redspot developed from a hardhat fork based on the MIT protocol, and removed parts related to Ethereum on its basis, and added functions related to Substrate and pallet-contracts modules. In the near future, Redspot will build more functions based on the core of hardhat.
