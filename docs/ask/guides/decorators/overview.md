# Decorators overview

ask! provides a set of decorators to allow developers to code smart contract in Assemblyscirpt. eg.`@contract`. To further define the decorator's behavior during compilation, ask! introduces parameters within decorator. eg. `@message({"mutates": false})`. Currently, ask! has mainly two types of decorators: class decorators and syntax decorators.

## contract
### class:
[`@contract`](./contract-decorator.md###@contract): marks this class as a contract

[@dynamic](././contract-decorator.md###@dynamic): marks this class as an existing contract for cross contract call

### property:
[`@state`](./contract-decorator.md###@state): marks this class property as state needs to be synced to blockchain 

### method:
[`@constructor`](./contract-decorator.md###@constructor): marks this method as constructor in instatiate a contract

[`@message`](./contract-decorator.md###@message): marks this method as a public method in a smart contract

## event
### class
[`@event`](./event-decorator.md###@event): marks this class as an event emitted during contract execution

### property:
[`@topic`](./event-decorator.md###@topic): marks this class property as a topic and to be indexed  

## metadata
`@doc`: provide documentation for the information generated by metadata.json. It can add documentation comments for @contract/@event/@message/@constructor declarations.

```typescript
@contract
@doc(desc = "MyToken conract that implement erc20 contract")
class MyToken {
  // ...
}
```
