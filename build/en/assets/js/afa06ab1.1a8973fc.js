This solution cannot bear the impact of large-scale applications and traffic, and cannot be expanded in time, because Node will become a significant bottleneck in the system. In Elara's architecture, only a small number of Nodes are required to provide basic data sources. Elara supports the access of a large number of users through the design of distributed architecture, the integration of multiple services, and the ultimate optimization of request access paths. The short-term development cost of the NodePool solution is low, but the unit cost of long-term service to users is extremely high.
