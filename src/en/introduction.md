# Substrate contract

## Contract overview

This book introduces a series of knowledge related to the contract system in Substrate. It is written by [Patract](https://patract.io/) and maintained by [Aten](https://github.com/atenjin). The repository address is located in [substrate-contracts-book](https://github.com/patractlabs/substrate-contracts-book), and we welcome you to contribute to this book.

This book mainly elaborates from the following three aspects.

* Contract platform (module) for running contracts
* Language for writing contracts
* Tools to assist contract development

Among them,`pallet-evm`(that is, the contract of the EVM/Solidity system) has relatively rich information in the Ethereum ecosystem, so I will not focus on it in this contract book. Other contract systems, such as `pallet-actor`,`libra` transplantation contract platform, , are in the early stage of research, so they will not be explained in this book.

This book introduces pallet-contracts (Wasm contracts) as the main body, and the content mainly includes:

Contract platform (module) to run the contract

* pallet-contracts

Language for writing contracts

* ink!
* Ask!
* Solang

Tools to assist in contract development

* Redspot
* Europa
* Elara

In order to give you a better understanding of how the pallet-contracts module and Wasm contracts operate, this book will also involve an introduction to Wasm and the blockchain contract model. I believe this book will definitely benefit you.
