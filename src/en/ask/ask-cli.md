# Ask-cli

Currently only a simple cli is provided to compile contracts. Ask! provides the `ask` command to compile the AskÔºÅ contract.

```sh
npx ask path/to/as-file
```

**Note** You need to use `yarn` or `npx` to execute the `ask` command to prevent repetitive errors of AssemblyScript dependency.
