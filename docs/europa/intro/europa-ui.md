# Europa UI

Europa ships with a powerful Graphic User Interface that helps user better understand the node and contract execution without spending too much time learning the configs and commands.

## Installation
### Download Binary Releases

Detailed release information can be found here [Release v0.3.32](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa-ui/releases/tag/v0.3.32).
Currently, 3 operating systems are supportd:
* **Windows** 10 (21H1 and above) [europa-ui-v0.3.32-x86_64-darwin.dmg](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa-ui/releases/download/v0.3.32/europa-ui-v0.3.32-x86_64-darwin.dmg)
* **MacOS** (10.15.7 and above) [europa-ui-v0.3.32-x86_64-linux.AppImage](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa-ui/releases/download/v0.3.32/europa-ui-v0.3.32-x86_64-linux.AppImage)
> MacOS doesn't support M1, but you can try to use Rosetta to run the binary package of macOS. We do not guarantee all compatibility.
* **Ubuntu** (20.04 and above) [europa-ui-v0.3.32-x86_64-win.exe](https://github.com/patractlabs/europa-ui/releases/download/v0.3.32/europa-ui-v0.3.30-x86_64-win.exe)
>  For Ubuntu, we only guarantee Ubuntu 20.04 and above to work. Europa UI won't run on Ubuntu 18.04 and below due to the compatibility of glibc.*

*NOTE* 

ink! Stabilize `seal_debug_message` after pr [paritytech/ink#902](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/commit/fdae16d7a9384ae4d475b99a7d86f72e1927e665). Thus, if use the ink! which after this commit, the `pallet-contracts` should support stable seal_debug_message either. 

To use ink! supports `seal_debug_message`, making sure running Europa >= v0.3.32 or node will report `Error: Other`. Otherwise, use Europa <= v0.3.30

## Start the Europa node

## Configure Europa

This is the entry where you can set all the configurations for Europa node.

* **Database Path**: Sets which database to load. Each database will have different block states.
* **Workspace**: Sets the subdirectory of database. You can have multiple workspace for a single database.
* **HTTP Port**: Set the RPC through http protocal
* **WS Port**: Set the RPC through websocket protocal
* **External Endpoint**: Connect to another Europa instance through Websocket
* **Redspot Projects**: Choose to register the Redspot Project path in the startup configuration item, so that starting Europa will be associated with the compiled contract under the Redspot project.


## Tabs
Once you finished config, the Europa node will be started automatically. On the top left, click on `â‰¡`

![image](../imgs/europa-ui.png)

* **Contracts**: Check the contracts deployed
* **Explorer**: Blockchain explorer, allow users to revert and forward blocks
* **Accounts**: Check existent addresses 
* **Blocks**: Check existent blocks
* **Extrinsics**: check extrinsics
* **Events**: check emitted events
* **Developer**: check chain states, send transaction, make rpc calls, check Europa Cli logs

## Explorer
![image](../imgs/explorer.png)

This page displays the mined blocks.

* `Go to Block`: Generate blocks to desinated height

* `Back to Block`: Revert the blockchain to desingated height and remove corresponding states in database.

## Accounts
![image](../imgs/europa_accounts.png)
* Add or delete accounts
* Transfer Balances
* Click on `Address` to check related `Extrinsics`

## Contracts
### Codes
![image](../imgs/europa_contracts.png)

The `upload& deploy contract` button allows users to upload and deploy contract in `**.format`
You can also deploy codes by other two methods:
* Deploy code through **Redspot** or other deployment tool through Europa RPC
* Setup the Redspot Project redo by uploading `redspot.config.ts` file

After successful deployment, you can check the deployed contract by clicking `Uploaded At Extrinsic`

### Instances
![image](../imgs/europa_instances.png)

The instance tab will display all existing contract instances. Click on `Address` will link to the contract page where you can check related functions, extrinsics and events.

Apart from normal `Read` to call the contract function , Europa-UI also allows the user to `Call with Trace` which will display the blockchain state changes for better debugging and testing purposes.

## Extrinsic
Europa-UI focuses on revealing more insights during contract developement. When entering a page of `Extrinsic` for method under `contract`.

### Env Trace
![image](../imgs/contract_extrinsic.png)

Europa-UI parses all input data for the extrinsic and display them under the `data` row. Aside from common fields for an extrinsic, Europa-UI also provide `Env Trace` which elaborates how contract executes in a lower level.

If contract execution contains an error, the error will be traped. You can check the Wasm backtrace message of Wasm Error by clicking on `More Details`.

### Cross-Contract Call 
For **Calling the Function of Another Contract**, Europa will "indent" the contract respectively to better demostrate the hierarchy. 

![image](../imgs/contract_call_contract.png)

As shown in the figure above, when calling contract "5EQLt" in the first row, contract "5EQLt" then calls the "5D1cq" contract and the "5FdGb" contract separately through cross-contract calls. The `erc20` and `miner_erc20` contract are called in the `all` contract.

### State
This page records the state changes caused by the extrinsic showd in the same page.

The state changes have 6 actions:

* Put: A state has been modified
* PutChild: A state under a certain sub-tree (sub trie) has been modified, where child_id refers to the index of this sub-tree
* KillChild: Remove all storage under a certain subtree, which is more common in the case of contract destruction
* ClearPrefix: delete all the states under the key matching the specified prefix
* ClearChildPrefix: Delete the state under all keys matching the specified prefix under a certain subtree
* Append: Append new content to the state under a key, mostly used to add new Event data.

Among those 6 actions, if you only care about the storage changes made by contract execution, you only need to track PutChild, KillChild, and ClearChildPrefix.


## Developer
The developer page aims to replace cli by allowing developer to check chain state, send extrinsic, make rpc calls and check the console logs.
